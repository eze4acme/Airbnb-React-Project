# Airbnb-React-Project Built Using Tailwind Css

 This React project was build using tailwind css and with every details of mobile responsiveness inclusive.
 
The essence of the project is to understand how to pass property from one component to another through props.

Again, to understand and to do conditional rendering with short circuit.

The following concept like the use of spread operator and importance of giving key to each instance of component were integrated.

The use of map method was use to map through array of object data to avoid writing imperative code and write declaratively.
